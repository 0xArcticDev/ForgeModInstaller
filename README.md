* The mod has not been updated for two full Minecraft releases (e.g. 1.4 -> 1.6)

* You have my sole permission and credit me in your post.

Using my source code in your own mod is also strictly prohibited unless I have said otherwise.

* You will credit me in your post.

* I have the right to put your mod in the 'add-ons' section of the mod's post.

So you want to use Mekanism in your mod pack?  Still a few rules for you.
