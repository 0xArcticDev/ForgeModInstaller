# About #

Mekanism is a Minecraft add-on featuring high-tech machinery that can be used to create powerful tools, armor, and weapons.

# Modpacks, websites, reviews, or anything else #

Some people really don't like others to review or distribute their mods, something which I honestly don't understand.  You are the ones who help get this mod into the Minecraft community's hands, which seems like a good thing from my perspective.
As long as you follow the terms laid out in the license below, go right ahead.  I honestly just don't want you messaging me on IRC or on the forums, asking my permission.  If you need proof, provide a link to this page.

# License #

**Note that this license exists for Mekanism v9.1 or later. Previous versions of Mekanism utilize the MIT license.**

Licenses are not really my friend -- strict closed source software really drives me nuts.  Even more, with a derivative work coded in a language such as Java, nothing can really prevent people from looking through my source with JD-GUI.  I learned to program through a combination of textbooks, trial-and-error and browsing open source projects.  As such, I have decided to utilize a fairly lenient policy in hopes that my work will educate and inspire others with interests in computer science.  

I'm choosing to not adopt a specific license, meaning that all rights to source code, assets and distributed binaries are reserved to me by default.  However, I've made some notable exceptions in regards to Mekanism's source code, which can be listed below.  Read each section carefully to make sure you understand exactly what you can and can't do.  Don't try to work in the 'grey area' - if it's not listed, don't attempt it.
